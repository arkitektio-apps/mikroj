## Choose your version

MikroJ comes in two major versions:

- The Developer Version
- The Bundled Version

The bundled version uses a set of community macros, that are constantly being updated and curated (please contribute), and is the best version if you are not planning to implement imageJ
macros yourself. As the bundled version is frozen in its functionality, this version also allows multiple users to share the same ImageJ instance and login with their useraccount.

The developer version lets you create new macros yourself (see documentation) and allows you to expose functionality that is specific to your imagej setup (e.g only working with a certain
subset of plugins). The developer version will be bound to be used by a specific user and you can't sign in with another user account. In this setup the application will also not be able to follow you around. You can also use the developer version to create your own bundled app, that then has functionality frozen in time).
